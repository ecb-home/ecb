Installation
************

  1. Unpack the ECB archive.

  2. Read the file `README' in the ECB-directory and install the
     required semantic- and eieio-version.

     *Note*: ECB maybe requires a newer version of these libraries than
     shipped with Emacs or XEmacs. You have to install exactly a version
     ECB requires and also to make sure that the correct version is
     loaded into (X)Emacs!

  3. Add the new ECB-directory to your `load-path' variable.

     You MUST add the ECB-install-directory to the `load-path' either
     by changing the `load-path' variable directly in your `.emacs' or
     `site-lisp/site-start.el' or by working with a file `subdirs.el'.

     *ATTENTION*: ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is
     not added to `load-path' and for example just loaded by

          (load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")

     Do not do this!

  4. Add to your `.emacs' or `site-lisp/site-start.el' the line:

          (require 'ecb)

Now ECB is ready for use but you can do these optional steps:

  5. Restart Emacs.

  6. Call `ecb-byte-compile'.  This byte compiles ECB. You can safely
     ignore all messages.  (You can also bytecompile ECB from the
     command-line either by using the `Makefile' or by using the
     batch-file `make.bat'. Just read the comments in that file you
     choose.)

  7. Install the supplied `ecb.info' The ECB distribution contains a
     file `ecb.info' which is the online-help of ECB in Info-format.
     You can install this online help so it's available in the
     Top-directory of Info. There are two ways to do this:

        - Use the command "install-info" if available on your system
          (recommended).

        - Copy the file `ecb.info' into the info-directory of Emacs and
          modify the file `dir' manually.

     It doesn't matter if you do not execute this step because the
     online help of ECB is always available though, see `ecb-show-help'
     (*note Interactive ECB commands::).

Overview
********

   ECB is a global minor-mode which offers a few "ECB-windows" for
browsing your sources comfortable with the mouse and the keyboard.
These "special" windows are also called "tree-buffer" in this manual.
There are currently three different types of ECB-windows/tree-buffers:

* Menu:

* ECB Directories::
* ECB Sources::
* ECB Methods::

   In addition to these ECB-windows you have always one or two
"edit-windows" (*note Working with the edit-window::) in the ECB-frame
and (if you want) at the bottom a "compilation-window", where all the
output of Emacs-compilation (compile, grep etc.) is shown (*note Temp-
and compilation-buffers::).


File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Directories,  Next: ECB Sources,  Prev: Overview,  Up: Overview

ECB Directories
===============

   * Select directories (and - if enabled - source files) in the
     "ECB-Directories" buffer by clicking a mouse button on the
     directory name or by hitting RETURN when the cursor is placed on
     the item line, *Note Usage of ECB::.

   * Directory names with a "[+]" symbol after (or before) them can be
     expanded/collapsed by clicking on the symbol, pressing the TAB key
     when the cursor is placed on the package line or clicking a mouse
     button on the item, *Note Usage of ECB::.

   * Right clicking on an item will open a popup menu where different
     operations on the item under the mouse cursor can be performed.

   * Pressing F1 in the ECB-directories buffer will offer adding a new
     source-path. Pressing F2 will open the ECB customization group
     (*note Customizing::) in the edit window. F3 shows the online help
     in the edit-window.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Sources,  Next: ECB Methods,  Prev: ECB Directories,  Up: Overview

ECB Sources
===========

   * Source files can be selected by clicking a mouse button (*note
     Working with the mouse::) or hitting RETURN (*note Working with
     the keyboard::) on the source row in the "ECB-Sources" or "ECB-
     History" windows.

     IMPORTANT: If you hold down the SHIFT-key while clicking with the
     primary mouse button (*note Working with the mouse::) or RETURN
     (*note Working with the keyboard::) on a source row in the
     ECB-Sources or ECB-History windows then the source will not be
     displayed in the edit-window but it will be scanned in the
     background and all its contents (e.g. methods and variables) are
     listed in the "ECB Methods" window (*note ECB Methods::. So you
     can get an overlook over the source without changing the buffer in
     the edit-window.

   * Clicking on the source file with the secondary mouse button or
     C-RETURN (*note Usage of ECB::) will open the source file in the
     other edit window.

   * Right clicking on a source file will open a popup menu where
     different operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be
     performed.


File: ecb.info,  Node: ECB Methods,  Prev: ECB Sources,  Up: Overview

ECB Methods
===========

   * The "ECB-Methods" buffer contains the methods (and variables, if
     you want) in the selected source file. When a method/variable is
     selected with the primary mouse button  or RETURN (*note Usage of
     ECB::) the edit buffer will jump to the method/variable.

   * Clicking on a method/variable with the secondary mouse button or
     C-RETURN (*note Usage of ECB::) will jump to the method in the
     other edit window.

Activation and Deactivation
***************************

   Call `M-x ecb-activate' and `M-x ecb-deactivate' to activate or
deactivate ECB. If you want ECB started in a new frame see the option
`ecb-new-ecb-frame' (default is nil). `ecb-activate' always raises and
selects the ECB-frame even if ECB is already started.

   Because ECB is a global minor-mode it can also be
(de)activated/toggled by `M-x ecb-minor-mode'.

   There are three options for auto. (de)activation ECB after
Emacs-start and also major-mode based. See `ecb-auto-activate',
`ecb-major-modes-activate' and `ecb-major-modes-deactivate'.

Working with the mouse in the ECB-windows
=========================================

   Normally you get best usage if you use ECB with a mouse. ECB
distinguishes between a "primary" and a "secondary" mouse-button:

   A click with the primary button causes the main effect in each
ECB-buffer:

   - ECB Directories: Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files
     in the ECB-Sources buffer.

   - ECB sources/history: Opening the file in that edit-window
     specified by the option `ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination'.

   - ECB Methods: Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified
     by the option `ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination'.

   Per default the complete node-name of an item in a tree-buffer is
displayed in the echo-area if the mouse moves over it, regardless if
the related window is the active one or not. You can get the same
effect if you click with the primary mouse-button onto a node while
SHIFT is held. In general: Via `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer' you
can specify in a detailled manner for every ECB tree-buffer when and
which node-info should be displayed in the minibuffer.

   IMPORTANT: Doing this SHIFT-click in the ECB-Sources or ECB-History
windows does not only show the node in the echo-area but it also opens
the clicked source only in the background and shows all its
methods/variables in ECB-Methods; the buffer of the edit-window is not
changed! This is very useful to get only an overlook for a certain
source.

   The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in
the other window (see the documentation
`ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination').

   With the option `ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons' the following
combinations of primary and secondary mouse-buttons are possible:

   - primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2 (means mouse-2 while
     CTRL-key is pressed). This is the default setting.

   - primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1

   - primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2

   If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and
activate ECB again to take effect

   In each ECB-buffer mouse-3 (= right button) opens a special context
popup-menu for the clicked item where you can choose several senseful
actions.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Working with the keyboard,  Next: Working with the edit-window,  Prev: Working with the mouse,  Up: Usage of ECB

Working with the keyboard in the ECB-windows
============================================

   ECB offers the `ecb-mode-map' which binds the most important
functions of ECB to keys so you can easily use ECB without a mouse.

   IMPORTANT: Do not modify `ecb-mode-map' directly! The option
`ecb-key-map' defines all ECB keybindings, including a common prefixkey
(This is by default `C-c .'). If there are conflicts with other
minor-modes or packages you can define very easy another prefix.
Please read carefully the description of `ecb-key-map'!

* Menu:

* Navigation::
* Incremental search::


File: ecb.info,  Node: Navigation,  Next: Incremental search,  Prev: Working with the keyboard,  Up: Working with the keyboard

Navigation
----------

   In the ECB-buffers RETURN and TAB are the most important keys:

   * RETURN does the same as the primary button and C-RETURN does the
     same as the secondary button. The terms primary and secondary are
     explained in *Note Working with the mouse::. S-RETURN is the same
     as the SHIFT-click (*note ECB Sources::). See also the option
     `ecb-tree-RET-selects-edit-window' and the function
     `ecb-toggle-RET-selects-edit-window' which is bound to `C-t' in
     each tree-buffer of ECB!

   * TAB always expands or collapses expandable nodes.

   The RETURN and TAB keys can not be (re)defined with `ecb-key-map'!

   If you set `ecb-tree-navigation-by-arrow' to not nil then the left-
and right-arrow keys work in the ECB tree-window in the following smart
way if onto an expandable node:

   * Left-arrow: If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise
     point jumps to the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree
     (higher means the next higher level or - if no higher level
     available - the next higher node on the same level).

   * Right-arrow: If node is not expanded then it will be expanded.

   Onto a not expandable node the horizontal arrow-keys go one
character in the senseful correct direction.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Incremental search,  Prev: Navigation,  Up: Working with the keyboard

Incremental search for a node in current tree-buffer
----------------------------------------------------

   Each displayable key (e.g. all keys normally bound to
`self-insert-command') is appended to the current seach-pattern. The
tree-buffer tries to jump to the first node which matching the current
search-pattern either as substring or as prefix (see below). If no
match is found then nothing is done. There are some special keys:

   * `backspace' and `delete': Delete the last character from the
     search-pattern.

   * `home': Delete the complete search-pattern

   * `end': Expand either to a complete node if current search-pattern
     is already unique or expands to the greates common substring or
     prefix of the nodes. If there are at least two nodes with the same
     greatest common-prefix than every hit of `end' jumps to the next
     node with this common prefix.

   For better overlooking the current search-pattern is shown in the
echo area.  After selecting a node with RET the search-pattern is
cleared out. With `ecb-tree-incremental-search' you can specify if the
current search-pattern must be a real prefix of the node (default) or
if any substring is matched.

   For faster and easier finding the right node in a ecb-window thi
incremental search ignores the following non interesting stuff:

   - any leading spaces

   - expand/collapse-buttons: [+] resp. [-]

   - protection-signs (+, -, #) in the method-window if uml-notation is
     used

   - variables types or returntypes in front of variable- or
     method-names.

   - const specifier for variables

   This means: Just type in the prefix (resp. a substring) of a class-,
variable-, method-, directory- or filename and ECB will bring you as
fast as possible to the node you want. Incremental node-search uses the
value of `case-fold-search'.

   Tip: The `ecb-minor-mode' offers you in the `ecb-mode-map'
(customizable via `ecb-key-map') some keys for selecting every window
of the ecb-frame. This makes window-selection a child압 play. For
example you can jump into the method-window by hitting `C-c . m'.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Working with the edit-window,  Next: Temp- and compilation-buffers,  Prev: Working with the keyboard,  Up: Usage of ECB

Working with the edit-window
============================

   ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-window as if
the edit-window would be the only window of the ECB-frame.

   ECB offers you to advice the following functions so they work best
with ECB:

   - `other-window'

   - `delete-window'

   - `delete-other-windows'

   - `split-window-horizontally'

   - `split-window-vertically'

   - `switch-to-buffer'

   - `switch-to-buffer-other-window'

   - `other-window-for-scrolling'

   The behavior of the adviced functions is:

   * All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their
     corresponding original functons but they always act as if the
     edit-window(s) of ECB would be the only window(s) of the
     ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of ECB seems to be a normal
     Emacs-frame to the user.

   * If called in a not edit-window of ECB all these function jumps
     first to the (first) edit-window, so you can never destroy the
     ECB-window layout unintentionally.

   * If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions
     behave exactly like the not adviced original versions!

   ATTENTION: If you want to work within the edit-window with splitting
and unsplitting the edit-window(s) it is highly recommended to use the
adviced-functions of ECB instead of the original Emacs-functions (see
above). Per default ECB does advice all of the functions mentioned
above but with the option `ecb-advice-window-functions' you can
customizes which functions should be adviced by ECB. Please read
carefully the documentation of this option!

   Another interesting option in the context of the edit-window and
these adviced functions is `ecb-layout-always-operate-in-edit-window'!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Temp- and compilation-buffers,  Next: Rebuilding the Methods buffer,  Prev: Working with the edit-window,  Up: Usage of ECB

Temp- and compilation-buffers display in ECB
============================================

   If you call any help in Emacs, e.g. by calling `describe-function',
or if you do a completion in the minibuffer, then Emacs displays the
result-buffer in another window. This behavior you have also in ECB.
If the edit-window is already splitted then the temp-buffer is
displayed in the "other" edit-window otherwise the edit-window will be
splitted first. The variables `temp-buffer-max-height' and
`temp-buffer-resize-mode' work also correctly with ECB.

   Same for all compilation output-buffers (e.g. after a `compile' or
`grep') and the variable `compilation-window-height'.

   This is default behavior of ECB. But there is also another way to
display such buffers:

   * With the option `ecb-compile-window-height' you can define if the
     ECB layout should contain per default a compilation-window at the
     bottom (and if yes the height of it). If yes ECB displays all
     output of compilation-mode (compile, grep etc.) in this special
     window. Same for displaying help-buffers or similar stuff.

   * With the option `ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' you can
     allow Emacs to enlarge temporally the ECB-compile-window in some
     situations.  Please read the comment of this option. See also the
     description of the function
     `ecb-toggle-enlarged-compilation-window'.

   * With the option `ecb-layout-switch-to-compilation-window' you can
     modify the switch-to-buffer...-functions to work best if your
     layout contains a compilation-window. See the docstring of this
     option.

   But because ECB works best without such a durable compilation-window
you should read the documentation of these two options carefully!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Rebuilding the Methods buffer,  Next: Changing the ECB-layout,  Prev: Temp- and compilation-buffers,  Up: Usage of ECB

Rebuilding the ECB-Methods buffer
=================================

   In almost all cases there is NO need to manually rebuild the
method-buffer, because it is always done automatically if necessary.
But nevertheless there exist a few rare scenarios where a complete
manual rebuild can be necessary. Here is one example:

   Depending on the semantic-version: If an elisp-file is parsed which
contains a defun X in the middle where the closing ) is missing, then
semantic parses only until this defun X is reached and you will get an
incomplete ECB-method buffer. In such a case you must complete the
defun X and then completely reparse the elisp-file and rebuild the ECB
method buffer!

   A complete manually rebuild is done by `ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer'.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Changing the ECB-layout,  Next: Redrawing the ECB-layout,  Prev: Rebuilding the Methods buffer,  Up: Usage of ECB

Changing and customizing the ECB-layout
=======================================

   ECB offers several predefined layouts. To see which layouts are
available and choose an appropriate one just customize the option
`ecb-layout-nr'. The docstring of this option explains how to see the
different available layouts.

   If you want to switch fast between some layouts see the option
`ecb-toggle-layout-sequence' and the command `ecb-toggle-layout' (*note
Simulating speedbar::)

   In addition to the general layout you can specify if the layout
should contain a durable compilation-window at the bottom of the frame,
see `ecb-compile-window-height' (*note Temp- and compilation-buffers::).

   Maybe you want also change the look&feel of the tree-buffers. Then
you can change the location of the collapse- and expand-symbols and the
indendation of sub-nodes in a tree. See `ecb-tree-indent' and
`ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Redrawing the ECB-layout,  Next: Hiding/Showing the ECB windows,  Prev: Changing the ECB-layout,  Up: Usage of ECB

Redrawing the ECB-layout
========================

   If you have unintenionally destroyed the ECB-layout, you can always
restore the layout with calling `ecb-redraw-layout'. This is even true,
if you get messages like "wrong-type-argument window-live-p #<window
222>".

   If the variable `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the
redraw is done by the `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
`ecb-redraw-layout-full'. But it's strongly recommended to use the
quick redraw only if you have really slow machines where a full redraw
takes several seconds because the quick redraw is not really safe and
may have some drawbacks! On normal machines the full redraw should be
done in << 1s!


File: ecb.info,  Node: Hiding/Showing the ECB windows,  Next: Interactive ECB commands,  Prev: Redrawing the ECB-layout,  Up: Usage of ECB

Hiding/Showing the ECB windows
==============================

   With `ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' you can hide/show all the ECB windows
without changing the activation state of ECB and also without
deactivating the advices for `delete-other-windows' and/or
`delete-window'. This is most useful if you use a layout like nr.10
(*note Tips and tricks::) or if you want to have maximum space for
editing and you don't need the browsing windows all the time.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Interactive ECB commands,  Prev: Hiding/Showing the ECB windows,  Up: Usage of ECB

Interactive ECB commands
========================

 - Command: ecb-minor-mode &optional arg
     Toggle ECB minor mode. With prefix argument ARG, turn on if
     positive, otherwise off. Return non-`nil' if the minor mode is
     enabled.

 - Command: ecb-activate
     Activates the ECB and creates all the buffers and draws the
     ECB-screen with the actually choosen layout (see `ecb-layout-nr').
     This function raises always the ECB-frame if called from another
     frame. This is the same as calling `ecb-minor-mode' with a
     positive argument.

 - Command: ecb-deactivate
     Deactivates the ECB and kills all ECB buffers and windows.

 - Command: ecb-update-directories-buffer
     Updates the ECB directories buffer.

 - Command: ecb-current-buffer-sync &optional force
     Synchronizes the ECB buffers with the current buffer. Unless FORCE
     is non-`nil' then do this only if current-buffer differs from the
     source displayed in the ECB tree-buffers.

 - Command: ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer
     Updates the methods buffer with the current buffer after deleting
     the complete previous parser-information, means no semantic-cache
     is used!  Point must stay in an edit-window otherwise nothing is
     done. This method is merely needed if semantic parses not the
     whole buffer because it reaches a not parsable code. Examples when
     a call to this function is necessary: If an elisp-file is parsed
     which contains in the middle a defun X where the closing ) is
     missing then semantic parses only until this defun X is reached
     and you will get an incomplete ECB-method buffer.  In such a case
     you must complete the defun X and then call this function to
     completely reparse the elisp-file and rebuild the ECB method
     buffer!  If you change only the name of a method or a variable and
     you want the new name be shown immediately in the ECB-method
     buffer then you must call this function.

 - Command: ecb-redraw-layout
     Redraw the ECB screen. If the variable `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly'
     is not nil then the redraw is done by the
     `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
     `ecb-redraw-layout-full'. But it's strongly recommended to use the
     quick redraw only if you have really slow machines where a full
     redraw takes several seconds because the quick redraw is not
     really safe and may have some drawbacks! On normal machines the
     full drawback should be done in << 1s!

 - Command: ecb-clear-history &optional clearall
     Clears the ECB history-buffer. If CLEARALL is `nil' then the
     behavior is defined in the option `ecb-clear-history-behavior'
     otherwise the value of CLEARALL overrides the value of this option:
        - < 0: Means not-existing-buffers

        - > 0: Means existing-buffers

        - = 0: Means all
     For further explanation see `ecb-clear-history-behavior'.

 - Command: ecb-add-all-buffers-to-history
     Add all current file-buffers to the history-buffer of ECB.

 - Command: ecb-show-help &optional format
     Shows the online help of ECB either in Info or in HTML format
     depending of the value of `ecb-show-help-format'. If called with
     prefix argument, i.e. if FORMAT is not nil then the user is
     prompted to choose the format of the help (Info or HTML).

 - Command: ecb-submit-problem-report
     Submit a problem report for the ECB to the ECB mailing-list. This
     command generates in the edit-window a problem-report which
     contains already the current values of all ECB options, the current
     backtrace-buffer if there is any and the current message-buffer.
     You will be asked for a problem-report subject and then you must
     insert a description of the problem. Please describe the problem
     as detailed as possible!

 - Command: ecb-goto-window-directories

 - Command: ecb-goto-window-sources

 - Command: ecb-goto-window-methods

 - Command: ecb-goto-window-history

 - Command: ecb-toggle-ecb-windows &optional arg
     Toggle visibilty of the ECB-windows. With prefix argument ARG,
     make visible if positive, otherwise invisible. This has nothing to
     do with (de)activating ECB but only affects the visibility of the
     ECB windows. ECB minor mode remains active!

 - Command: ecb-toggle-layout
     Toggles between the layouts defined in
     `ecb-toggle-layout-sequence'.  Note: This function works by
     changing the options `ecb-layout-nr' and
     `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' but only for current
     Emacs-session.

 - Command: ecb-toggle-enlarged-compilation-window &optional arg
     Toggle whether the `ecb-compile-window' is enlarged or not. If ARG
     > 0 then enlarge to a sensefull value (see below), if ARG <= 0
     then shrink `ecb-compile-window' to `ecb-compile-window-height'
     and if ARG is nil then toggle the enlarge-state.

     The `ecb-compile-window' is enlarged to the following value: At
     least to the value of `ecb-compile-window-height' and max. to half
     of the frame-height of the ECB-frame, best depending on the values
     of `compilation-window-height' (before ECB was started!) and the
     number of lines of current buffer in `ecb-compile-window'. If
     `compilation-window-height' is set before ECB was started then ECB
     never enlarges the `ecb-compile-window' over the value of
     `compilation-window-height'! Changing this option during activated
     ECB takes first effect after restarting ECB!

 - Command: ecb-cycle-switch-to-compilation-buffer
     Switch to the given compilation buffer in the compilation window.

 - Command: ecb-cycle-through-compilation-buffers
     Cycle through all compilation buffers currently open and display
     them within the compilation window `ecb-compile-window'. If the
     currently opened buffer within the compilation window is not a
     compilation buffer, we jump to the first compilation buffer. If
     not we try to loop through all compilation buffers. If we hit the
     end we go back to the beginning. See `ecb-compilation-buffer-p'.

 - Command: ecb-upgrade-options
     Check for all ECB-options if their current value is compatible to
     the defined type. If not upgrade it to the new type or reset it to
     the default-value of current ECB. Try also to upgrade renamed
     options.  Displays all upgraded or reset options with their old
     (before the upgrade/reset) and new values.

 - Command: ecb-display-upgraded-options
     Display a message-buffer which options have been upgraded or reset.

 - Command: ecb-download-ecb
     Download ECB from the ECB-website and install it. For this the
     utilities "wget", "tar" and "gzip" are needed which are available
     for unix and also for windows with cygwin. All utilities must
     reside in your PATH!

     If you are behind a firewall and you have to use a proxy you maybe
     need the following wget-configuration in your file `~/.wgetrc':

          # Define your proxies (where 8080 and 8081 are examples
          # for the portnumbers)
          http_proxy = http://your.proxy.com:8080
          ftp_proxy  = http://your.ftpproxy.com:8081
          
          # If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
          use_proxy = on

     ECB will try to download the following url:
     "<ecb-download-url>ecb-<ecb-download-version>.tar.gz". For this the
     options `ecb-download-url' and `ecb-download-version' must be set
     correct, whereas the default value of the former one should always
     be correct.

     After sucessfull downloading the new ECB will be installed in a
     directory parallel to current ECB-directory. After adding this new
     directory tp `load-path' and restarting Emacs the new ECB version
     can be activated by `ecb-activate'.

   Most of these functions are also available via the menu "ECB" and
also via the ECB keymap with prefix `C-c .' (see `ecb-minor-mode' for a
complete list of the keybindings).

Customizing ECB
***************

All customization of ECB is divided into the following customize groups:

   * ecb-general: General customization of ECB

   * ecb-directories: Customization of the ECB-directories buffer.

   * ecb-sources: Customization of the ECB-sources buffer.

   * ecb-methods: Customization of the ECB-methods buffer.

   * ecb-history: Customization of the ECB-history buffer.

   * ecb-layout: Customization of the layout of ECB.

   * ecb-faces: All faces used by ECB to highlight nodes and some other
     stuff.

   * ecb-download: Options for downloading another ECB version from
     within ECB.

   You can highly customize all the ECB behavior/layout so just go to
this groups and you will see all well documented ECB-options. The
easiest access for this customize groups is via the menu "ECB".

   Here are the most important options (it is recommended to check the
following options before working with ECB):

`ecb-source-path'
     Where ECB can find your sources. You must set this option!

`ecb-show-help-format'
     Should the online help of ECB be displayed in the standard Info
     format or in HTML format in a web-browser.

`ecb-auto-activate'
`ecb-major-modes-activate'
`ecb-major-modes-deactivate'
     Auto. (de)activation of ECB

`ecb-key-map'
     All ECB-keybindings incl. a common prefixkey (*note Working with
     the keyboard::).

`ecb-new-ecb-frame'
     Should ECB create a new frame at activation time.

`ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons'
`ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination'
     Define how to use the mouse (*note Working with the mouse::).

`ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before'
`ecb-tree-indent'
     The look&feel of the trees. Maybe you like a value of 4 for the
     latter one if you display the expand-symbol before (*note Changing
     the ECB-layout::).

`ecb-source-file-regexps'
     Which files will (not) be shown in ECB.

`ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer'
     When and which node-info should be displayed in the minibuffer?

`ecb-layout-nr'
     The ECB layout, means which windows you want to be displayed in the
     ECB-frame and also the location of these windows (*note Changing
     the ECB-layout::).

`ecb-token-display-function'
`ecb-type-token-display'
     How to display the entries in the ECB-method window.

   But especially all the options in the customize groups 'ecb-layout',
'ecb-methods' and 'ecb-face-options' are also worth to be checked.

Submitting a problem report
***************************

   If you run into problems with ECB you can/should send a problem
report to the ECB mailing list <ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net>. ECB
offers you a command which does all necessary for you to send a problem
report. Just call `ecb-submit-problem-report'! Please read the
documentation of this command, *Note Interactive ECB commands::.

   This command creates a problem-report buffer for you. After that you
get a menu "Mail" (dependend on the mail-package used, the menu can
have a different name) with commands to send the problem report. But
for this the varibale `mail-user-agent' must be configured right for
your system. If you can앖 get working this mechanism you can simply
copy the whole problem-report buffer after filling it out and sending
it with your standard mail-client to <ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net>!

   Please read also the documentation of the option `ecb-debug-mode' and
switch on the debug mode of ECB (also available in the Help-menu of
ECB!) before submitting a problem-report!

Upgrading ECB
*************

   ECB offers the possibility to upgrade to newer versions direct from
the ECB-website. This can be done with `ecb-download-ecb' if the tools
wget, tar and gzip are installed onto the system and a connection to
the web is available. Please read the documentation of
`ecb-download-ecb' and the options of the customize-group
'ecb-download'!

Changing faces in the ECB tree-buffers
======================================

   There are two basic faces:

   * `ecb-default-general-face': Basic face for displaying an
     ECB-tree-buffer.

   * `ecb-default-highlight-face': Basic face for highlighting the
     current node in an ECB-tree-buffer.

   With this faces you can change the basic attributes easily and fast
for ALL ECB-tree-buffers. But you are also able to display each
ECB-tree-buffer with different faces. For further details see the
doc-strings of the faces `ecb-default-general-face' and
`ecb-default-highlight-face' (just call `customize-face' to see the
doc-strings). The options of the group 'ecb-face-options' are also
interesting.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Small screens,  Next: Simulating speedbar,  Prev: Changing faces,  Up: Tips and tricks

Working with small screens
==========================

   If your screen is very small so you need every sqare-centimeter for
displaying the buffer which you want to edit, ECB offers you a special
layouts, where only the ECB-methods buffer is displayed on top or on
left-side. Here comes what you should/can do to work best with ECB in
such a situation:

   * First customize your ECB:

       1. Customize `ecb-layout-nr' to layout nr. 10 (on top) or nr. 11
          (on left-side)

       2. Ensure that `ecb-compile-window-height' is nil.

       3. Optional: Ajust the `ecb-windows-height' resp.
          `ecb-windows-width'.

       4. Save your changes.

   * To edit your buffers: Call `ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' (also
     available via the menu "ECB" and by `C-c . w') or
     `ecb-hide-ecb-windows' to hide the ECB-method buffer so you get
     all the place of your screen for editing.

   * To browse and select functions: Call `ecb-toggle-ecb-windows' or
     `ecb-show-ecb-windows' to make the ECB-method buffer visible if
     not already. If you want select a method/variable with the
     keyboard instead with the mouse you should read the section *Note
     Working with the keyboard:: in this online help!

   The possibility of hiding temporally the ECB windows like described
above is also useful for all the other layouts.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Simulating speedbar,  Next: Optimze scrolling,  Prev: Small screens,  Up: Tips and tricks

Simulating speedbar without an extra frame
==========================================

   You can simulate a speedbar-like layout within ONE frame by doing the
following:

  1. Customize `ecb-layout-nr' to layout nr. 11, 14, 15 or 16 dependend
     to what you like.

  2. Optional: Ensure that `ecb-compile-window-height' is nil.

  3. Optional: Ajust the `ecb-windows-width'.

  4. Optional: Customize `ecb-toggle-layout-sequence' and toggle very
     fast between several layouts by `ecb-toggle-layout'. See the
     doc-strings!

  5. Optional: Customize `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' to not
     nil if the choosen layout (see 1. and 4.) contains a
     directories-tree-buffer.

  6. Save your changes.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Optimze scrolling,  Next: Large directories,  Prev: Simulating speedbar,  Up: Tips and tricks

Optimze scrolling in the edit-window
====================================

   Emacs 20.X seems to slow down scrolling if there is a horizontal
split in the frame and/or a lot of overlays in the buffer which is
scrolled.  This is independend of ECB! But because almost all layouts
of ECB uses horizontal splits of the frame and because ECB is based on
semantic which uses overlays intensively there can be poor scrolling
performance in large buffers, especially with java-buffers in
`jde-mode'.

   This scrolling performance can be increased a lot if the options
`scroll-conservatively' and `scroll-step' are set appropriatelly: The
former one should have a value of 0 during ECB is active and the latter
one a value of either 0 or > 1 (the exact value depends on the power of
your machine).

   As far as we know this is not a problem of Emacs 21.X or XEmacs. With
these versions of Emacs there should be no scrolling problem even with
`scroll-step' has value 1.


File: ecb.info,  Node: Large directories,  Prev: Optimze scrolling,  Up: Tips and tricks

Working with large directories
==============================

   If `ecb-source-path' contains directories with many files and
subdirs, especially if these directories are mounted net-drives ("many"
means here something > 1000, dependend on the speed of the
net-connection and the machine), actualizing the sources- and/or
directories- buffer of ECB (if displayed in current layout!) can slow
down dramatically.  If this is a problem the contents of certain
directories can be cached which increases the speed a lot. See
`ecb-cache-directory-contents'.

Entry points for elisp programmers
**********************************

   Variables an elisp-program can use:

   * `ecb-source-path-functions'

   Available hooks:

   * `ecb-activate-before-new-frame-created-hook'

   * `ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook'

   * `ecb-activate-hook'

   * `ecb-deactivate-hook'

   * `ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook'

   Look at the documentation of these variables and hooks to get
description.

   Remark to the library tree-buffer: This library is ECB independent
and can be used for other applications too. But such an application is
not allowed to use any of the variables of tree-buffer.el especially not
the following:

   `tree-buffers': Only for internal use. It contains all tree-buffers
of current Emacs-instance, means all tree-buffers of all applications
which uses currently tree-buffers. Every application must store its own
tree-buffers in an own variable! For example: ECB stores its
tree-buffers in `ecb-tree-buffers'!

   An application can only use the methods tree-buffer.el provides!

Known conflicts with other packages
***********************************

   Here is a list of known conflicts of ECB with other packages and
helpful solutions/hints/workarounds:

* Menu:

* VC::
* follow-mouse::
* avoid::
* calendar::
* calculator::


File: ecb.info,  Node: VC,  Next: follow-mouse,  Prev: Conflicts,  Up: Conflicts

Package VC (Version Control)
============================

   The variable `vc-delete-logbuf-window' must be set to nil during
active ECB. This can be done with the hooks mentioned above.


File: ecb.info,  Node: follow-mouse,  Next: avoid,  Prev: VC,  Up: Conflicts

Package follow-mouse.el
=======================

   ECB works very well with follow-mouse if follow-mouse is turned on
BEFORE ECB is activated (e.g. within the `ecb-activate-hook'). But if
you activate follow-mouse first after ECB is already activated, then
the follow-mouse stuff prevents the complete node-name to be displayed
in the echo-area if mouse moves over it. Because ECB has a much more
intelligent mouse tracking mechanism than follow-mouse the follow-mouse
stuff profit from ECB and works even better and saver as without
activated ECB!


File: ecb.info,  Node: avoid,  Next: calendar,  Prev: follow-mouse,  Up: Conflicts

Package avoid.el
================

   With GNU Emacs 20.X ECB must deactivate `mouse-avoidance-mode' if the
option `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer' activates for at least one
ECB tree-buffer 'if-too-long or 'always. This is done automatically but
only as long ECB is activated.


File: ecb.info,  Node: calendar,  Next: calculator,  Prev: avoid,  Up: Conflicts

Package calendar.el
===================

   With activated ECB `calendar' does not shrink it압 window to the
small size but splits the window equally. But if you add this to your
`.emacs' it works:

     (add-hook 'initial-calendar-window-hook
               (function (lambda ()
                           (when (and ecb-minor-mode (ecb-point-in-edit-window))
                             (or (= (frame-width) (window-width))
                                 (shrink-window (- (window-height) 9)))))))


File: ecb.info,  Node: calculator,  Prev: calendar,  Up: Conflicts

Package calculator.el
=====================

   If the edit-window is already splitted then calling `calculator' uses
the whole "other" edit-window for the calculator. With an unsplitted
edit-window the calculator window has it압 normal size of about 2
lines. Therefore it압 recommended to set `calculator-electric-mode'
during ECB activation to not nil so calculator uses always the
echo-area instead of creating a new small window!
