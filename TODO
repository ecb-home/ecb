- other-window ignores all the ECB windows.  I realize that the goal was to only
  have the side windows as non-important to your current editing activity but if
  you want to use ECB without the mouse then this is impossible :(

   KB: In current version the advice of 'other-window' can either be
   deactivated or - and this is the better way - you can set the
   behavior of it via the option 'ecb-other-window-jump-behavior'!

- single click on any ECB buffers should NOT do anything.  This should be moved
  to mouse-2

   KB: No, this should not be moved. The left- and the middle-mouse
   button jumps to different edit windows amd this is a very useful behavior.

- more readme.txt, history.txt, and makefile to README, HISTORY and
  Makefile
   
   KB: I agree.

- All of the ECB special buffer accept text input( I can type in this buffer if
  I wanted to ).  This buffer should be read-only.  

   KB: I agree.

- KB: Special keymap for all ECB-buffers for better keyboard-usability:
  If the ECB-buffers are readonly (see above) then we can do the
  following: Instead of scrolling with the mouse each inserted
  character scrolls to the next matching tree-node. Example:
  Inserting 'e' scrolls to the first node beginning with "e...".
  Then inserting an 'c' scrolls to the first node beginning with
  "ec...". Maybe we need an somehow intelligent mechanism...

- KB: Easy selecting of a certain ECB-buffer with a ECB-keymap like:
  [C-c C-e ...] as ECB-keybindings:
   d: Directory buffer
   s: Source-Buffer
   m: Method-buffer
   h: History-Buffer

- KB: the utility- (also know as compile-) window stores not only the
  last compilation-buffer but a list of recent utility-buffers
   (compilation-, help-, etc. buffers) which can the easily cycled
   through by a new ecb-command (maybe also bound to a [C-c C-e ...] key?
