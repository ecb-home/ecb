- other-window ignores all the ECB windows.  I realize that the goal was to only
  have the side windows as non-important to your current editing activity but if
  you want to use ECB without the mouse then this is impossible :(

- single click on any ECB buffers should NOT do anything.  This should be moved
  to mouse-2

- more readme.txt, history.txt, and makefile to README, HISTORY and Makefile 

- All of the ECB special buffer accept text input( I can type in this buffer if
  I wanted to ).  This buffer should be read-only.
