<p>ECB (Emacs Code Browser) is a source code browser for Emacs. It is a
global minor-mode which displays a couple of windows that can be used
to browse directories, files and methods. It supports method parsing
for Java, C, C++, Elisp and some more.

<p>The latest version of ECB can always be found at the URL:
&lt;<code>http://home.swipnet.se/mayhem/ecb.html</code>&gt;

<p>To send bug reports, or participate in discussions about ECB, use the
mailing list <a href="mailto:ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net">ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net</a> via the URL:

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol type=1 start=1>

<li>Unpack the ECB archive.

<li>Read the file <code>README</code> in the ECB-directory and install the
required semantic- and eieio-version.

<li>Add the new ECB-directory to your <code>load-path</code> variable.

<p>You MUST add the ECB-install-directory to the <code>load-path</code> either
by changing the <code>load-path</code> variable directly in your
<code>.emacs</code> or <code>site-lisp/site-start.el</code> or by working with
a file <code>subdirs.el</code>.

<p>ATTENTION:
ECB is NOT properly installed if it's directory is not added to
<code>load-path</code> and for example just loaded by

<br><pre>(load-file "/path/to/ecb/ecb.el")
</pre>

<p>Do not do this!

</p><li>Add to your <code>.emacs</code> or <code>site-lisp/site-start.el</code> the line:

<br><pre>(require 'ecb)
</pre>
</ol>

<p>Optional steps:

<ol type=1 start=5>
</p><li>Restart Emacs. 
<li>Call <code>ecb-byte-compile</code>. 
This byte compiles ECB. You can safely ignore all messages. 
(You can also bytecompile ECB from the command-line either by using
the <code>Makefile</code> or by using the batch-file <code>make.bat</code>. Just
read the comments in that file you choose.)

<li>Install the supplied <code>ecb.info</code>
The ECB distribution contains a file <code>ecb.info</code> which is the
online-help of ECB in Info-format. You can install this online help so
it's available in the Top-directory of Info. There are two ways to do
this:

<ul>
<li>Use the command "install-info" if available on your system
(recommended). 
<li>Copy the file <code>ecb.info</code> into the info-directory of Emacs and
modify the file <code>dir</code> manually. 
</ul>

<p>It doesn't matter if you do not execute this step because the online
help of ECB is always available though, see <code>ecb-show-help</code>
(see <a href="#Interactive%20ECB%20commands">Interactive ECB commands</a>).

</ol>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>ECB is a global minor-mode which offers a few <dfn>ECB-windows</dfn> for
browsing your sources comfortable with the mouse and the keyboard. 
These "special" windows are also called <dfn>tree-buffer</dfn> in this
manual. There are currently three different types of
ECB-windows/tree-buffers:

<ul>
<li><a accesskey=1 href="#ECB%20Directories">ECB Directories</a>: 
<li><a accesskey=2 href="#ECB%20Sources">ECB Sources</a>: 
<li><a accesskey=3 href="#ECB%20Methods">ECB Methods</a>: 
</ul>

<p>In addition to these ECB-windows you have always one or two
<dfn>edit-windows</dfn> (see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20edit-window">Working with the edit-window</a>) in the
ECB-frame and (if you want) at the bottom a <dfn>compilation-window</dfn>,
where all the output of Emacs-compilation (compile, grep etc.) is
shown (see <a href="#Temp-%20and%20compilation-buffers">Temp- and compilation-buffers</a>).

Previous:<a rel=previous accesskey=p href="#Overview">Overview</a>,
Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Overview">Overview</a>
<br>

<h3>ECB Directories</h3>

<ul>
<li>Select directories (and - if enabled - source files) in the
<dfn>ECB-Directories</dfn> buffer by clicking a mouse button on the directory
name or by hitting RETURN when the cursor is placed on the item line,
See <a href="#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>.

<li>Directory names with a "[+]" symbol after (or before) them can be
expanded/collapsed by clicking on the symbol, pressing the TAB key
when the cursor is placed on the package line or clicking a mouse
button on the item, See <a href="#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>.

<li>Right clicking on an item will open a popup menu where different
operations on the item under the mouse cursor can be performed.

<li>Pressing F1 in the ECB-directories buffer will offer adding a new
source-path. Pressing F2 will open the ECB customization group
(see <a href="#Customizing">Customizing</a>) in the edit window. F3 shows the online help in
the edit-window. 
</ul>

<h3>ECB Sources</h3>

<ul>
<li>Source files can be selected by clicking a mouse button
(see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20mouse">Working with the mouse</a>) or hitting RETURN (see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20keyboard">Working with the keyboard</a>) on the source row in the <dfn>ECB-Sources</dfn> or
<dfn>ECB- History</dfn> windows.

<p>IMPORTANT: If you hold down the SHIFT-key while clicking with the
primary mouse button (see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20mouse">Working with the mouse</a>) or RETURN
(see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20keyboard">Working with the keyboard</a>) on a source row in the ECB-Sources
or ECB-History windows then the source will not be displayed in the
edit-window but it will be scanned in the background and all its
contents (e.g. methods and variables) are listed in the <dfn>ECB
Methods</dfn> window (see <a href="#ECB%20Methods">ECB Methods</a>. So you can get an overlook over
the source without changing the buffer in the edit-window.

</p><li>Clicking on the source file with the secondary mouse button or
C-RETURN (see <a href="#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>) will open the source file in
the other edit window.

<li>Right clicking on a source file will open a popup menu where different
operation on the item under the mouse cursor can be performed. 
</ul>

<br>

<h3>ECB Methods</h3>

<ul>
<li>The <dfn>ECB-Methods</dfn> buffer contains the methods (and variables, if you
want) in the selected source file. When a method/variable is selected
with the primary mouse button  or RETURN (see <a href="#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>) the
edit buffer will jump to the method/variable.

<li>Clicking on a method/variable with the secondary mouse button or C-RETURN
(see <a href="#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>) will jump to the method in the other edit window.

<br>

<h2>Activation and Deactivation</h2>

<p>Call <kbd>M-x ecb-activate</kbd> and <kbd>M-x ecb-deactivate</kbd> to activate or
deactivate ECB. If you want ECB started in a new frame see the option
<code>ecb-new-ecb-frame</code> (default is nil). <code>ecb-activate</code> always
raises and selects the ECB-frame even if ECB is already started.

<p>Because ECB is a global minor-mode it can also be
(de)activated/toggled by <kbd>M-x ecb-minor-mode</kbd>.

<p>There are three options for auto. (de)activation ECB after Emacs-start
and also major-mode based. See <code>ecb-auto-activate</code>,
<code>ecb-major-modes-activate</code> and <code>ecb-major-modes-deactivate</code>.

<h3>Working with the mouse in the ECB-windows</h3>

<p>Normally you get best usage if you use ECB with a mouse. ECB
distinguishes between a <dfn>primary</dfn> and a <dfn>secondary</dfn>
mouse-button:

<p>A click with the primary button causes the main effect in each ECB-buffer:

<ul>
<li>ECB Directories:
Expanding/collapsing nodes and displaying files in the ECB-Sources
buffer.

<li>ECB sources/history:
Opening the file in that edit-window specified by the option
<code>ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination</code>.

<li>ECB Methods:
Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by the option
<code>ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination</code>. 
</ul>

<p>Per default the complete node-name of an item in a tree-buffer is displayed in
the echo-area if the mouse moves over it, regardless if the related window is
the active one or not. You can get the same effect if you click with the
primary mouse-button onto a node while SHIFT is held. In general: Via
<code>ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer</code> you can specify in a detailled manner for
every ECB tree-buffer when and which node-info should be displayed in the
minibuffer.

<p>IMPORTANT: Doing this SHIFT-click in the ECB-Sources or ECB-History
windows does not only show the node in the echo-area but it also opens the
clicked source only in the background and shows all its methods/variables in
ECB-Methods; the buffer of the edit-window is not changed! This is very
useful to get only an overlook for a certain source.

<p>The secondary mouse-button is for opening (jumping to) the file in the other
window (see the documentation <code>ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination</code>).

<p>With the option <code>ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons</code> the following
combinations of primary and secondary mouse-buttons are possible:

<ul>
<li>primary: mouse-2, secondary: C-mouse-2 (means mouse-2 while CTRL-key
is pressed). This is the default setting. 
<li>primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1
<li>primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2
</ul>

<p>If you change this during ECB is activated you must deactivate and activate
ECB again to take effect

<p>In each ECB-buffer mouse-3 (= right button) opens a special context popup-menu
for the clicked item where you can choose several senseful actions.

<h3>Working with the keyboard in the ECB-windows</h3>

<p>ECB offers the <code>ecb-mode-map</code> which binds the most important
functions of ECB to keys so you can easily use ECB without a mouse.

<p>IMPORTANT: Do not modify <code>ecb-mode-map</code> directly! The option
<code>ecb-key-map</code> defines all ECB keybindings, including a common
prefixkey (This is by default <kbd>C-c .</kbd>). If there are conflicts with
other minor-modes or packages you can define very easy another prefix. 
Please read carefully the description of <code>ecb-key-map</code>!

<ul>

<li><a accesskey=2 href="#Incremental%20search">Incremental search</a>: 
</ul>

Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Working%20with%20the%20keyboard">Working with the keyboard</a>
<br>

<h4>Navigation</h4>

<p>In the ECB-buffers RETURN and TAB are the most important keys:

<ul>
<li>RETURN does the same as the primary button and C-RETURN does the same
as the secondary button. The terms primary and secondary are explained
in <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20mouse">Working with the mouse</a>. S-RETURN is the same as the
SHIFT-click (see <a href="#ECB%20Sources">ECB Sources</a>). See also the option
<code>ecb-tree-RET-selects-edit-window</code> and the function
<code>ecb-toggle-RET-selects-edit-window</code> which is bound to <kbd>C-t</kbd>
in each tree-buffer of ECB!

<li>TAB always expands or collapses expandable nodes. 
</ul>

<p>The RETURN and TAB keys can not be (re)defined with <code>ecb-key-map</code>!

<p>If you set <code>ecb-tree-navigation-by-arrow</code> to not nil then the left- and
right-arrow keys work in the ECB tree-window in the following smart way if
onto an expandable node:

<ul>
<li>Left-arrow: If node is expanded then it will be collapsed otherwise
point jumps to the next "higher" node in the hierarchical tree (higher
means the next higher level or - if no higher level available - the
next higher node on the same level).

<li>Right-arrow: If node is not expanded then it will be expanded. 
</ul>

<p>Onto a not expandable node the horizontal arrow-keys go one character in the
senseful correct direction.

Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Working%20with%20the%20keyboard">Working with the keyboard</a>
<br>

<h4>Incremental search for a node in current tree-buffer</h4>

<p>Each displayable key (e.g. all keys normally bound to <code>self-insert-command</code>)
is appended to the current seach-pattern. The tree-buffer tries to jump to the
first node which matching the current search-pattern either as substring or as
prefix (see below). If no match is found then nothing is done. There are some
special keys:

<ul>
<li><kbd>backspace</kbd> and <kbd>delete</kbd>:
Delete the last character from the search-pattern.

<li><kbd>home</kbd>:
Delete the complete search-pattern

<li><kbd>end</kbd>:
Expand either to a complete node if current search-pattern is already
unique or expands to the greates common substring or prefix of the
nodes. If there are at least two nodes with the same greatest
common-prefix than every hit of <kbd>end</kbd> jumps to the next node with this
common prefix. 
</ul>

<p>For better overlooking the current search-pattern is shown in the echo area. 
After selecting a node with RET the search-pattern is cleared out. With
<code>ecb-tree-incremental-search</code> you can specify if the current search-pattern
must be a real prefix of the node (default) or if any substring is matched.

<p>For faster and easier finding the right node in a ecb-window thi incremental
search ignores the following non interesting stuff:

<ul>
<li>any leading spaces
<li>expand/collapse-buttons: [+] resp. [-]
<li>protection-signs (+, -, #) in the method-window if uml-notation is used
<li>variables types or returntypes in front of variable- or method-names. 
<li>const specifier for variables
</ul>

<p>This means: Just type in the prefix (resp. a substring) of a class-,
variable-, method-, directory- or filename and ECB will bring you as
fast as possible to the node you want. Incremental node-search uses
the value of <code>case-fold-search</code>.

<p>Tip: The <code>ecb-minor-mode</code> offers you in the <code>ecb-mode-map</code>
(customizable via <code>ecb-key-map</code>) some keys for selecting every window
of the ecb-frame. This makes window-selection a child´s play. For
example you can jump into the method-window by hitting <kbd>C-c . m</kbd>.

<h3>Working with the edit-window</h3>

<p>ECB offers you all what you need to work with the edit-window as if
the edit-window would be the only window of the ECB-frame.

<p>ECB offers you to advice the following functions so they work best with ECB:

<ul>
<li><code>other-window</code>
<li><code>delete-window</code>
<li><code>delete-other-windows</code>
<li><code>split-window-horizontally</code>
<li><code>split-window-vertically</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer</code>
<li><code>switch-to-buffer-other-window</code>
<li><code>other-window-for-scrolling</code>
</ul>

<p>The behavior of the adviced functions is:

<ul>
<li>All these adviced functions behaves exactly like their corresponding
original functons but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB
would be the only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of
ECB seems to be a normal Emacs-frame to the user.

<li>If called in a not edit-window of ECB all these function jumps first
to the (first) edit-window, so you can never destroy the ECB-window
layout unintentionally.

<li>If called in another frame than the ECB-frame these functions behave
exactly like the not adviced original versions! 
</ul>

<p>ATTENTION: If you want to work within the edit-window with splitting
and unsplitting the edit-window(s) it is highly recommended to use the
adviced-functions of ECB instead of the original Emacs-functions (see
above). Per default ECB does advice all of the functions mentioned
above but with the option <code>ecb-advice-window-functions</code> you can
customizes which functions should be adviced by ECB. Please read
carefully the documentation of this option!

<br>

<h3>Temp- and compilation-buffers display in ECB</h3>

<p>If you call any help in Emacs, e.g. by calling <code>describe-function</code>, or
if you do a completion in the minibuffer, then Emacs displays the
result-buffer in another window. This behavior you have also in ECB. 
If the edit-window is already splitted then the temp-buffer is
displayed in the "other" edit-window otherwise the edit-window will be
splitted first. The variables <code>temp-buffer-max-height</code> and
<code>temp-buffer-resize-mode</code> work also correctly with ECB.

<p>Same for all compilation output-buffers (e.g. after a <code>compile</code> or
<code>grep</code>) and the variable <code>compilation-window-height</code>.

<p>This is default behavior of ECB. But there is also another way to
display such buffers:

<ul>
<li>With the option <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> you can define if the ECB
layout should contain per default a compilation-window at the bottom
(and if yes the height of it). If yes ECB displays all output of
compilation-mode (compile, grep etc.) in this special window. Same for
displaying help-buffers or similar stuff.

<li>With the option <code>ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge</code> you can allow
Emacs to enlarge temporally the ECB-compile-window in some situations. 
Please read the comment of this option. See also the description of
the function <code>ecb-toggle-enlarged-compilation-window</code>. 
</ul>

<p>But because ECB works best without such a durable compilation-window
you should read the documentation of these two options carefully!

<br>

<h3>Rebuilding the ECB-Methods buffer</h3>

<p>In almost all cases there is NO need to manually rebuild the
method-buffer, because it is always done automatically if necessary. 
But nevertheless there exist a few rare scenarios where a complete
manual rebuild can be necessary. Here is one example:

<p>Depending on the semantic-version: If an elisp-file is parsed which
contains a defun X in the middle where the closing ) is missing, then
semantic parses only until this defun X is reached and you will get an
incomplete ECB-method buffer. In such a case you must complete the
defun X and then completely reparse the elisp-file and rebuild the ECB
method buffer!

<p>A complete manually rebuild is done by <code>ecb-rebuild-methods-buffer</code>.

Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Usage%20of%20ECB">Usage of ECB</a>
<br>

<h3>Changing and customizing the ECB-layout</h3>

<p>ECB offers several predefined layouts. To see which layouts are
available and choose an appropriate one just customize the option
<code>ecb-layout-nr</code>. The docstring of this option explains how to see
the different available layouts.

<p>If you want to switch fast between some layouts see the option
<code>ecb-toggle-layout-sequence</code> and the command
<code>ecb-toggle-layout</code> (see <a href="#Simulating%20speedbar">Simulating speedbar</a>)

<p>In addition to the general layout you can specify if the layout should
contain a durable compilation-window at the bottom of the frame, see
<code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> (see <a href="#Temp-%20and%20compilation-buffers">Temp- and compilation-buffers</a>).

<p>Maybe you want also change the look&amp;feel of the tree-buffers. Then you
can change the location of the collapse- and expand-symbols and the
indendation of sub-nodes in a tree. See <code>ecb-tree-indent</code> and
<code>ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before</code>.

<h3>Redrawing the ECB-layout</h3>

<p>If you have unintenionally destroyed the ECB-layout, you can always
restore the layout with calling <code>ecb-redraw-layout</code>. This is even
true, if you get messages like "wrong-type-argument window-live-p
#&lt;window 222&gt;".

<p>If the variable <code>ecb-redraw-layout-quickly</code> is not nil then the redraw
is done by the <code>ecb-redraw-layout-quickly</code> function, otherwise by
<code>ecb-redraw-layout-full</code>. But it's strongly recommended to use the
quick redraw only if you have really slow machines where a full redraw
takes several seconds because the quick redraw is not really safe and
may have some drawbacks! On normal machines the full redraw should be
done in &lt;&lt; 1s!

<h3>Hiding/Showing the ECB windows</h3>

<p>With <code>ecb-toggle-ecb-windows</code> you can hide/show all the ECB windows
without changing the activation state of ECB and also without
deactivating the advices for <code>delete-other-windows</code> and/or
<code>delete-window</code>. This is most useful if you use a layout like nr.10
(see <a href="#Tips%20and%20tricks">Tips and tricks</a>) or if you want to have maximum space for
editing and you don't need the browsing windows all the time.

<h2>Customizing ECB</h2>

<p>All customization of ECB is divided into the following customize
groups:

<ul>
<li>ecb-general: General customization of ECB
<li>ecb-directories: Customization of the ECB-directories buffer. 
<li>ecb-sources: Customization of the ECB-sources buffer. 
<li>ecb-methods: Customization of the ECB-methods buffer. 
<li>ecb-history: Customization of the ECB-history buffer. 
<li>ecb-layout: Customization of the layout of ECB. 
<li>ecb-faces: All faces used by ECB to highlight nodes and some other stuff. 
<li>ecb-download: Options for downloading another ECB version from within ECB. 
</ul>

<p>You can highly customize all the ECB behavior/layout so just go to
this groups and you will see all well documented ECB-options. The
easiest access for this customize groups is via the menu "ECB".

<p>Here are the most important options (it is recommended to check the following
options before working with ECB):

<dl>
<dt><code>ecb-source-path</code>
<dd>Where ECB can find your sources. You must set this option! 
<br><dt><code>ecb-show-help-format</code>
<dd>Should the online help of ECB be displayed in the standard Info format
or in HTML format in a web-browser. 
<br><dt><code>ecb-auto-activate</code>
<dt><code>ecb-major-modes-activate</code>
<dt><code>ecb-major-modes-deactivate</code>
<dd>Auto. (de)activation of ECB
<br><dt><code>ecb-key-map</code>
<dd>All ECB-keybindings incl. a common prefixkey (see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20keyboard">Working with the keyboard</a>). 
<br><dt><code>ecb-new-ecb-frame</code>
<dd>Should ECB create a new frame at activation time. 
<br><dt><code>ecb-primary-secondary-mouse-buttons</code>
<dt><code>ecb-primary-mouse-jump-destination</code>
<dd>Define how to use the mouse (see <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20mouse">Working with the mouse</a>). 
<br><dt><code>ecb-tree-expand-symbol-before</code>
<dt><code>ecb-tree-indent</code>
<dd>The look&amp;feel of the trees. Maybe you like a value of 4 for the
latter one if you display the expand-symbol before (see <a href="#Changing%20the%20ECB-layout">Changing the ECB-layout</a>). 
<br><dt><code>ecb-source-file-regexps</code>
<dd>Which files will (not) be shown in ECB. 
<br><dt><code>ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer</code>
<dd>When and which node-info should be displayed in the minibuffer? 
<br><dt><code>ecb-layout-nr</code>
<dd>The ECB layout, means which windows you want to be displayed in the
ECB-frame and also the location of these windows (see <a href="#Changing%20the%20ECB-layout">Changing the ECB-layout</a>). 
<br><dt><code>ecb-token-display-function</code>
<dt><code>ecb-type-token-display</code>
<dd>How to display the entries in the ECB-method window. 
</dl>

<p>But especially all the options in the customize groups 'ecb-layout',
'ecb-methods' and 'ecb-face-options' are also worth to be checked.

<h2>Submitting a problem report</h2>

<p>If you run into problems with ECB you can/should send a problem report
to the ECB mailing list <a href="mailto:ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net">ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net</a>. ECB
offers you a command which does all necessary for you to send a
problem report. Just call <code>ecb-submit-problem-report</code>! Please read the
documentation of this command, See <a href="#Interactive%20ECB%20commands">Interactive ECB commands</a>.

<p>This command creates a problem-report buffer for you. After that you
get a menu "Mail" (dependend on the mail-package used, the menu can
have a different name) with commands to send the problem report. But
for this the varibale <code>mail-user-agent</code> must be configured right for
your system. If you can´t get working this mechanism you can simply
copy the whole problem-report buffer after filling it out and sending
it with your standard mail-client to
<a href="mailto:ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net">ecb-list@lists.sourceforge.net</a>!

<p>Please read also the documentation of the option <code>ecb-debug-mode</code> and
switch on the debug mode of ECB (also available in the Help-menu of
ECB!) before submitting a problem-report!

<h2>Upgrading ECB</h2>

<p>ECB offers the possibility to upgrade to newer versions direct from
the ECB-website. This can be done with <code>ecb-download-ecb</code> if the tools
wget, tar and gzip are installed onto the system and a connection to
the web is available. Please read the documentation of
<code>ecb-download-ecb</code> and the options of the customize-group
'ecb-download'!

<h3>Changing faces in the ECB tree-buffers</h3>

<p>There are two basic faces:

<ul>
<li><code>ecb-default-general-face</code>:
Basic face for displaying an ECB-tree-buffer. 
<li><code>ecb-default-highlight-face</code>:
Basic face for highlighting the current node in an ECB-tree-buffer. 
</ul>

<p>With this faces you can change the basic attributes easily and fast
for ALL ECB-tree-buffers. But you are also able to display each
ECB-tree-buffer with different faces. For further details see the
doc-strings of the faces <code>ecb-default-general-face</code> and
<code>ecb-default-highlight-face</code> (just call <code>customize-face</code> to see the
doc-strings). The options of the group 'ecb-face-options' are also
interesting.

<h3>Working with small screens</h3>

<p>If your screen is very small so you need every sqare-centimeter for
displaying the buffer which you want to edit, ECB offers you a special
layouts, where only the ECB-methods buffer is displayed on top or on
left-side. Here comes what you should/can do to work best with ECB in
such a situation:

<ul>
<li>First customize your ECB:

<ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Customize <code>ecb-layout-nr</code> to layout nr. 10 (on top) or nr. 11 (on left-side)
<li>Ensure that <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is nil. 
<li>Optional: Ajust the <code>ecb-windows-height</code> resp. <code>ecb-windows-width</code>. 
<li>Save your changes.
</ol>

<li>To edit your buffers:
Call <code>ecb-toggle-ecb-windows</code> (also available via the menu "ECB" and
by <kbd>C-c . w</kbd>) or <code>ecb-hide-ecb-windows</code> to hide the ECB-method buffer
so you get all the place of your screen for editing.

<li>To browse and select functions:
Call <code>ecb-toggle-ecb-windows</code> or <code>ecb-show-ecb-windows</code> to
make the ECB-method buffer visible if not already. If you want select
a method/variable with the keyboard instead with the mouse you should
read the section <a href="#Working%20with%20the%20keyboard">Working with the keyboard</a> in this online help! 
</ul>

<p>The possibility of hiding temporally the ECB windows like described
above is also useful for all the other layouts.

<h3>Simulating speedbar without an extra frame</h3>

<p>You can simulate a speedbar-like layout within ONE frame by doing the
following:

<ol type=1 start=1>
</p><li>Customize <code>ecb-layout-nr</code> to layout nr. 11, 14, 15 or 16 dependend to
what you like. 
<li>Optional: Ensure that <code>ecb-compile-window-height</code> is nil. 
<li>Optional: Ajust the <code>ecb-windows-width</code>. 
<li>Optional: Customize <code>ecb-toggle-layout-sequence</code> and toggle very fast
between several layouts by <code>ecb-toggle-layout</code>. See the doc-strings! 
<li>Optional: Customize <code>ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer</code> to not
nil if the choosen layout (see 1. and 4.) contains a
directories-tree-buffer. 
<li>Save your changes.
</ol>

<h3>Optimze scrolling in the edit-window</h3>

<p>Emacs 20.X seems to slow down scrolling if there is a horizontal split
in the frame and/or a lot of overlays in the buffer which is scrolled. 
This is independend of ECB! But because almost all layouts of ECB uses
horizontal splits of the frame and because ECB is based on semantic
which uses overlays intensively there can be poor scrolling
performance in large buffers, especially with java-buffers in
<code>jde-mode</code>.

<p>This scrolling performance can be increased a lot if the options
<code>scroll-conservatively</code> and <code>scroll-step</code> are set appropriatelly: The
former one should have a value of 0 during ECB is active and the
latter one a value of either 0 or &gt; 1 (the exact value depends on the
power of your machine).

<p>As far as we know this is not a problem of Emacs 21.X or XEmacs. With
these versions of Emacs there should be no scrolling problem even with
<code>scroll-step</code> has value 1.

<h3>Working with large directories</h3>

<p>If <code>ecb-source-path</code> contains directories with many files and subdirs,
especially if these directories are mounted net-drives ("many" means
here something &gt; 1000, dependend on the speed of the net-connection
and the machine), actualizing the sources- and/or directories- buffer
of ECB (if displayed in current layout!) can slow down dramatically. 
If this is a problem the contents of certain directories can be cached
which increases the speed a lot. See <code>ecb-cache-directory-contents</code>.

<h2>Entry points for elisp programmers</h2>

<p>Variables an elisp-program can use:

<ul>
<li><code>ecb-source-path-functions</code>
</ul>

<p>Available hooks:

<ul>
<li><code>ecb-activate-before-new-frame-created-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-activate-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-deactivate-hook</code>
<li><code>ecb-current-buffer-sync-hook</code>
</ul>

<p>Look at the documentation of these variables and hooks to get description.

<p>Remark to the library tree-buffer: This library is ECB independent and
can be used for other applications too. But such an application is not
allowed to use any of the variables of tree-buffer.el especially not
the following:

<p><code>tree-buffers</code>: Only for internal use. It contains all
tree-buffers of current Emacs-instance, means all tree-buffers of all
applications which uses currently tree-buffers. Every application must
store its own tree-buffers in an own variable! For example: ECB stores
its tree-buffers in <code>ecb-tree-buffers</code>!

<p>An application can only use the methods tree-buffer.el provides!

<h2>Known conflicts with other packages</h2>

<h3>Package VC (Version Control)</h3>

<p>The variable <code>vc-delete-logbuf-window</code> must be set to nil during
active ECB. This can be done with the hooks mentioned above.

<br>

<h3>Package follow-mouse.el</h3>

<p>ECB works very well with follow-mouse if follow-mouse is turned on
BEFORE ECB is activated (e.g. within the <code>ecb-activate-hook</code>). But if
you activate follow-mouse first after ECB is already activated, then
the follow-mouse stuff prevents the complete node-name to be displayed
in the echo-area if mouse moves over it. Because ECB has a much more
intelligent mouse tracking mechanism than follow-mouse the
follow-mouse stuff profit from ECB and works even better and saver as
without activated ECB!

<br>

<h3>Package avoid.el</h3>

<p>With GNU Emacs 20.X ECB must deactivate <code>mouse-avoidance-mode</code> if the
option <code>ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer</code> activates for at least one
ECB tree-buffer 'if-too-long or 'always. This is done automatically
but only as long ECB is activated.

<br>

<h3>Package calendar.el</h3>

<p>With activated ECB <code>calendar</code> does not shrink it´s window to the small
size but splits the window equally. But if you add this to your
<code>.emacs</code> it works:

<br><pre>(add-hook 'initial-calendar-window-hook
          (function (lambda ()
                      (when (and ecb-minor-mode (ecb-point-in-edit-window))
                        (or (= (frame-width) (window-width))
                            (shrink-window (- (window-height) 9)))))))
</pre>

Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Conflicts">Conflicts</a>
<br>

<h3>Package calculator.el</h3>

<p>If the edit-window is already splitted then calling <code>calculator</code> uses
the whole "other" edit-window for the calculator. With an unsplitted
edit-window the calculator window has it´s normal size of about 2
lines. Therefore it´s recommended to set <code>calculator-electric-mode</code>
during ECB activation to not nil so calculator uses always the
echo-area instead of creating a new small window!
