;;; Commentary:
;;
;; ECB stands for "Emacs Code Browser" and is a source code browser for
;; (X)Emacs. It is a global minor-mode which displays a couple of windows that
;; can be used to browse directories, files and file-contents like methods and
;; variables. It supports source-code parsing for semantic-supported languages
;; like Java, C, C++, Elisp and Scheme as well as for source-types supported
;; "only" by imenu or etags (e.g. perl, TeX, LaTeX etc.).

;;; Installation
;;
;; To use the Emacs code browser add the ECB files to your load path and add the
;; following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;; If you want autoloading ECB after first start:
;;
;;    (require 'ecb-autoloads)
;;
;; or if you want loading the complete ECB:
;;
;;    (require 'ecb)
;;
;; Optional: You can byte-compile ECB with `ecb-byte-compile' after the
;;           ECB-package is loaded


;;; Requirements
;;
;; - Semantic, author-version between 1.4 and 1.4.9
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/semantic.shtml).
;; - Eieio, author-version between 0.17 and 0.17.9
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
;; - speedbar, author version 0.14beta1 or higher
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml)
;; - Optional: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDEE package
;;   (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.


;;; Activation
;;
;; ECB is either activated and started by calling
;;    M-x ecb-activate
;; or
;;    via the menu "Tools --> Start Code Browser (ECB)"
;;
;; ECB can also be (de)activated/toggled by M-x ecb-minor-mode.
;;
;; After activating ECB you should call `ecb-show-help' to get a detailed
;; description of what ECB offers to you and how to use ECB.


;;; Availability
;;
;; The latest version of the ECB is available at http://ecb.sourceforge.net

;;; History
;;
;; For the ChangeLog of this file see the CVS-repository. For a complete
;; history of the ECB-package see the file NEWS.

;;; Code:

;; IMPORTANT: The version-number is auto-frobbed from the Makefile. Do not
;; change it here!

Do not mistake this option with `ecb-auto-activate'. The latter one is for
activating ECB after Emacs-startup \(even without opening a buffer) and this
one is for defining for which major-modes ECB should be activated if the mode
goes active!

The behavior is like follows: If a mode is contained in this option ECB is
activated after activating this mode \(if ECB was deactivated before) or the
ECB-windows are shown if ECB was already active but its windows were hidden.
In every case ECB is activated with visible ECB-windows afterwards!

For every major mode there can be specified an `ecb-layout-name':
- default: The value customized with `ecb-layout-name' is chosen.
- a string: ECB is activated with this layout-name. This changes the value of
  `ecb-layout-name' but only for current emacs-session!
But the layout is only changed if ECB was activated, if just the ECB-windows
were shown, the current layout is used!

There are two additional options:
- none: No major-modes should activate ECB automatically.
- a regexp: This means all major-modes which are not listed in
  `ecb-major-modes-deactivate' activate ECB except the `symbol-name' of
  `major-mode' matches this regexp. If this option is set then the default
  regexp excludes all Info- and customize-buffers because this buffers should
  not change anything in the ECB-activation state.

- deactivate: ECB is completely deactivated after activating the `major-mode'.

There are two additional options:
- none: No major-modes should deactivate/hide ECB automatically.
- A cons for the meaning \"All except the activated modes of
  `ecb-major-modes-activate'\". The car of this cons can be:
   + hide-all-except-activated: All major-modes which are not listed in

   + deactivate-all-except-activated: All major-modes which are not listed in

unsplitted and point is in the edit-window to avoid changing unnecessarily or

If not nil then an integrated speedbar will be updated after selecting a

Of course this option makes only sense if the integrated speedbar is displayed

This option can have the following values:
- t: Always update speedbar.
- nil: Never update speedbar.
- auto: Update when senseful \(see scenarios below)
- <function>: A user-defined function. The function is called after a
  directory is selected, gets the selected directory as argument and has to
  return nil if the the integrated speedbar should NOT be updated.

Two example-scenarios where different values for this option can be senseful:

If `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is not nil or you have a layout
where an ECB-sources-buffer is visible then you probably want to use the
ECB-directories-buffer \(and/or the ECB-sources-buffer) for directory- and
file-browsing. If you have in addition an integrated speedbar running then you
probably want to use speedbar instead of the ECB-methods-buffer for
source-content-browsing. In this case you probably want the speedbar not be
updated because you do not need speedbar reflecting the current-directory
contents but only the contents of the currently selected source-file and the
integrated speedbar updates itself autom. for the latter one!

If `ecb-show-sources-in-directories-buffer' is nil and there is also no
ECB-sources-buffer visible in the current layout then you probably want to use
an integrated speedbar for browsing directory-contents \(i.e. the files) and
file-contents \(instead of the ECB-methods-buffer for example). In this case
you probably want the speedbar updated because you need speedbar reflecting
the current-directory contents so you can select files.

The value 'auto \(see above) takes exactly these two scenarios into account."

  the pendant is `ecb-name-nonterminal'.

this functionality set the function for a major-mode \(e.g. `jde-mode') to

type-tokens can be useful. For a description when this option is evaluated
look at `ecb-token-display-function'!

This functionality is set on a major-mode base, i.e. for every major-mode a
different setting can be used. The value of this option is a list of
cons-cells:
- The car is either a major-mode symbol or the special symbol 'default which
  means if no setting for a certain major-mode is defined then the cdr of
  the 'default cons-cell is used.
- The cdr is a list of 3-element-lists:
  1. First entry is a semantic type specifier in string-form. Current
     available type specifiers are for example \"class\", \"interface\",
     \"struct\", \"typedef\" and \"enum\". In addition to these ones there is
     also a special ECB type specifier \"group\" which is related to grouping
     tokens \(see `ecb-post-process-semantic-tokenlist' and
     `ecb-group-function-tokens-with-parents'). Any arbitrary specifier can be
     set here but if it is not \"group\" or not known by semantic it will be
     useless.
  2. Second entry is a flag which indicates if the type-specifier string from
     \(1.) itself should be removed \(if there is any) from the display.
  3. Third entry is the face which is used in the ECB-method window to display
     type-tokens with this specifier. ECB has some predefined faces for this
     \(`ecb-type-token-class-face', `ecb-type-token-struct-face',
     `ecb-type-token-typedef-face', `ecb-type-token-enum-face' and
     `ecb-type-token-group-face') but any arbitrary face can be set here. This
     face is merged with the faces semantic already uses to display a token,
     i.e. the result is a display where all face-attributes of the ECB-face
     take effect plus all face-attributes of the semantic-faces which are not
     set in the ECB-face \(with XEmacs this merge doesn't work so here the
     ECB-face replaces the semantic-faces; this may be fixed in future
     versions).

The default value is nil means there is no special ECB-displaying of
type-tokens in addition to the displaying and colorizing semantic does. But a
value like the following could be a useful setting:

  \(\(default
     \(\"class\" t ecb-type-token-class-face)
     \(\"group\" nil ecb-type-token-group-face))
    \(c-mode
     \(\"struct\" nil ecb-type-token-struct-face)
     \(\"typedef\" nil ecb-type-token-typedef-face)))

This means that in `c-mode' only \"struct\"s and \"typedef\"s are displayed
with special faces \(the specifiers itself are not removed) and in all other
modes \"class\"es and grouping-tokens \(see `ecb-token-display-function',
`ecb-group-function-tokens-with-parents') have special faces and the \"class\"
specifier-string is removed from the display.

Token Type
----------

A Semantic token type symbol \(for all possible type symbols see documentation
of semantic):
- include
- type
- variable
- function
- rule
- section \(chapters and sections in `info-mode')
- def \(definitions in `info-mode')

or one of the following:

- t:      All token types not specified anywhere else in the list.
- parent: The parents of a type.

Display Type
------------

A symbol which describes how the tokens of this type shall be shown:

- expanded:  The tokens are shown in an expanded node.
- collapsed: The tokens are shown in a collapsed node.
- flattened: The tokens are added to the parent node.
- hidden:    The tokens are not shown.

Sort Method
-----------

A symbol describing how to sort the tokens of this type:

- name:   Sort by the token name.
- access: Sort by token access (public, protected, private) and then by name.
- nil:    Don't sort tokens. They appear in the same order as in the source
          buffer.

  "Set the expand level of the nodes in the ECB-methods-buffer.
This command asks in the minibuffer for an indentation level LEVEL. With this
LEVEL you can precisely specify which level of nodes should be expanded. LEVEL
means the indentation-level of the nodes.

A LEVEL value X means that all nodes with an indentation-level <= X are
expanded and all other are collapsed. A negative LEVEL value means all visible
nodes are collapsed.

Nodes which are not indented have indentation-level 0!

Which node-types are expanded \(rsp. collapsed) by this command depends on
the options `ecb-methods-nodes-expand-spec' and
`ecb-methods-nodes-collapse-spec'! With optional argument FORCE-ALL all tokens
will be expanded/collapsed regardless of the values of these options.

Examples:
- LEVEL = 0 expands only nodes which have no indentation itself.
- LEVEL = 2 expands nodes which are either not indented or indented once or
  twice
- LEVEL ~ 10 should normally expand all nodes unless there are nodes which
  are indented deeper than 10.

Note 1: This command switches off auto. expanding of the method-buffer if
`ecb-expand-methods-switch-off-auto-expand' is not nil. But it can be switched
on again quickly with `ecb-toggle-auto-expand-token-tree' or \[C-c . a].

Note 2: All this is only valid for file-types parsed by semantic. For other
file types which are parsed by imenu or etags \(see

  "*Specifies all key-bindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map.
The value is a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the
key-bindings. The cdr is a list of key-bindings each of them a list again. A
key-binding has the following form:

  '\(<common-prefix-flag> <keysequence> <function>) where

<common-prefix-flag>: If t then the common-prefixkey defined as car of the
                      value \(see above) is used.
<keysequence>: If the common prefixkey is used then the final key-binding is the
               concatenation of the common-prefixkey \(see above) and this
               keysequence.
<function>: The function to bind to the key. This can also be a
            lambda-expression .

It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as first key
of your common-prefixkey!

You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the syntax needed
by `read-kbd-macro' or `kbd'. This means you can insert the key in the same
manner \"C-h k\" displays keysequences. Here is the summary of the syntax:

Text is divided into \"words \" separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in \"C-c SPC\".

  * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent special
   control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

  * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, <left> or <f1>, represents
    a function key. \(Note that in the standard configuration, the function
    key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.). You can use angle
    brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are not required there.

  * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by up
    to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with codes
    above \377.

  * One or more prefixes M- \(meta), C- \(control), S- \(shift), A- \(alt),
    H- \(hyper), and s- \(super) may precede a character or key notation. For
    function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
    C-<down> = <C-down>. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
    C-M-x.
    Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except that the
    Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional minus sign:
    M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.

  * The `^' notation for control characters also works:  ^M = C-m."
