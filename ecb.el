;;; Commentary:
;;
;; ECB stands for "Emacs Code Browser".  While Emacs already has good
;; *editing* support for many modes, its *browsing* support is somewhat
;; lacking. That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational
;; windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.
;;
;; The informational windows can contain:
;;
;; - A directory tree,
;; - a list of source files in the current directory,
;; - a list of functions/classes/methods/... in the current file, (ECB uses
;;   the Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this list so all
;;   languages supported by any of these tools are automatically supported by
;;   ECB too)
;; - a history of recently visited files, 
;; - the Speedbar and
;; - output from compilation (the "*compilation*" window) and other modes like
;;   help, grep etc. or whatever a user defines to be displayed in this
;;   window.
;;
;; As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows visible,
;; even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.
;;
;; It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie which
;; informational windows should be displayed where. ECB comes with a number of
;; ready-made window layouts to choose from.
;;
;; Here is an ascii-screenshot of what ECB offers you:

;;; Installation
;;
;; To use the Emacs code browser add the ECB files to your load path and add the
;; following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;; If you want autoloading ECB after first start:
;;
;;    (require 'ecb-autoloads)
;;
;; or if you want loading the complete ECB:
;;
;;    (require 'ecb)
;;
;; Optional: You can byte-compile ECB with `ecb-byte-compile' after the
;;           ECB-package is loaded


;;; Requirements
;;
;; - Semantic, author-version between >= 1.4
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/semantic.shtml).
;; - Eieio, author-version >= 0.17
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
;; - speedbar, author version >= 0.14beta1
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml)
;; - Optional: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDEE package
;;   (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.


;;; Activation
;;
;; ECB is either activated and started by calling
;;    M-x ecb-activate
;; or
;;    via the menu "Tools --> Start Code Browser (ECB)"
;;
;; ECB can also be (de)activated/toggled by M-x ecb-minor-mode.
;;
;; After activating ECB you should call `ecb-show-help' to get a detailed
;; description of what ECB offers to you and how to use ECB.


;;; Availability
;;
;; The latest version of the ECB is available at http://ecb.sourceforge.net

;;; History
;;
;; For the ChangeLog of this file see the CVS-repository. For a complete
;; history of the ECB-package see the file NEWS.

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'silentcomp))


;; We need this libraries already here if we miss some requirements and we
;; want to offer the user to download them.
(require 'ecb-upgrade)
(require 'ecb-util)


;; TODO: Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>: When the cedet 2.X library is
;; stable then we should handle here cedet instead of these three single
;; libraries. 

;; if we miss some of the requirements we offer the user to download and
;; install them if Emacs is started interactive or - in batch mode - we
;; report an error.

- ECB Methods: Jumping to the method in that edit-window specified by the

  method-buffer but not displaying the source-file in the edit-window.
+ Methods-buffer: Narrowing to the clicked method/variable/ect... \(see

  semantic!

In addition always the whole node-name is displayed in the minibuffer after a
POWER-click \(for this see also `ecb-show-node-info-in-minibuffer').

  pressed). This is the default setting.
- primary: mouse-1, secondary: C-mouse-1
- primary: mouse-1, secondary: mouse-2

before the layout is redrawn \(for example after calling `ecb-redraw-layout')

following sequence of hooks:
1. 'ecb-activate-before-layout-draw-hook' \(this one)

Precondition for such a hook:
Current buffer is the buffer of the currently selected edit-window.

Postcondition for such a hook:
Point must stay in the same edit-window as before evaluating the hook.

Important note: If `ecb-window-sync' is not nil `ecb-current-buffer-sync' is
running either every time Emacs is idle or even after every command \(see
`ecb-window-sync-delay'). So these hooks can be really called very often!
Therefore each function of this hook should/must check in an efficient way at
beginning if its task have to be really performed and then do them only if
really necessary! Otherwise performance of Emacs could slow down
dramatically!

It is strongly recommended that each function added to this hook uses the
macro `ecb-do-if-buffer-visible-in-ecb-frame' at beginning! See
`ecb-speedbar-current-buffer-sync' and `ecb-eshell-current-buffer-sync' for

  "*Specifies all key-bindings for the ECB minor-mode key-map.
The value is a cons-cell where the car is a common-prefix key for all the
key-bindings. The cdr is a list of key-bindings each of them a list again. A
key-binding has the following form:

  '\(<common-prefix-flag> <keysequence> <function>) where

<common-prefix-flag>: If t then the common-prefixkey defined as car of the
                      value \(see above) is used.
<keysequence>: If the common prefixkey is used then the final key-binding is the
               concatenation of the common-prefixkey \(see above) and this
               keysequence.
<function>: The function to bind to the key. This can also be a
            lambda-expression .

It is highly recommended to use one of the standard keys C-c or C-x as first key
of your common-prefixkey!

You MUST change this option via customize to take effect!

All keysequences must be inserted as a string and must follow the syntax needed
by `read-kbd-macro' or `kbd'. This means you can insert the key in the same
manner \"C-h k\" displays keysequences. Here is the summary of the syntax:

Text is divided into \"words \" separated by whitespace. Except for the words
described below, the characters of each word go directly as characters of the
keysequence. The whitespace that separates words is ignored. Whitespace in the
macro must be written explicitly, as in \"C-c SPC\".

  * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent special
   control characters. The words must be written in uppercase.

  * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, <left> or <f1>, represents
    a function key. \(Note that in the standard configuration, the function
    key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.). You can use angle
    brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they are not required there.

  * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed by up
    to six octal digits. This is the only way to represent keys with codes
    above \377.

  * One or more prefixes M- \(meta), C- \(control), S- \(shift), A- \(alt),
    H- \(hyper), and s- \(super) may precede a character or key notation. For
    function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the brackets:
    C-<down> = <C-down>. The prefixes may be written in any order: M-C-x =
    C-M-x.
    Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except that the
    Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional minus sign:
    M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.

  * The `^' notation for control characters also works:  ^M = C-m."
