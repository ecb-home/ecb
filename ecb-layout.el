;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Contains functions for settings the ECB layout.
;;
;; This file is part of the ECB package which can be found at:
;; http://ecb.sourceforge.net

;; This file has been re-implemented by Klaus Berndl <klaus.berndl@sdm.de>.
;; What has been done:
;; Completely rewritten the layout mechanism for better customizing, adding
;; new layouts, better redrawing and more straightforward code.
;; 1. Now all user-layouting is done by customizing the new option
;;    `ecb-layout-name' or by the command `ecb-change-layout'. The function
;;    `ecb-redraw-layout' (formally known as 'ecb-set-layout) can still be
;;    called interactively. But it just redraws the layout specified in
;;    `ecb-layout-name'. All changes to the layout must be made by customizing
;;    this new option. Please read the very detailed comment of
;;    `ecb-layout-name'!
;; 2. Adding new layouts is now much easier and more straightforward: We have
;;    now a main core-layout function (`ecb-redraw-layout-full') which is the
;;    "environment" for the specific "layout-functions". The core function
;;    does first some layout independent actions, then calls the
;;    "layout-function" for the name which has been set in `ecb-layout-name'
;;    and after that it does some layout independent actions again (see the
;;    comments in this function). See the macro `ecb-layout-define' and the
;;    command `ecb-create-new-layout'!
;;
;; Background-info: For each layout-type (ecb-windows left, right, top and
;; left-right) there is one function:
;; 'ecb-delete-window-ecb-windows-[left|right|top|leftright]'.
;; These functions follow these guide-lines:
;; - Preconditions for these functions:
;;   + the edit-area is splitted - at least in two edit-windows
;;   + The function gets two arguments: The window to delete (if nil then the
;;     current window has to be deleted) and the list of all current
;;     edit-windows.
;;   + These functions are always(!) called with deactivated advices of
;;     `delete-window' function.
;;   + These functions can only use `delete-window' of the set of maybe
;;     adviced window functions, because of a bug in advice.el only one
;;     function´s advice can be deactivated within a advice itself!
;; - What must they do: Doing the appropriate action (e.g.
;;   `ecb-delete-window-ecb-windows-left' must delete the window. This action
;;   must be done appropriate for the current ECB-layout type (see
;;   postconditions)
;; - Postcondition of these functions:
;;   + The named edit-window must be deleted and all ecb-windows in the
;;     ecb-frame must have the layout like before the delete.
;;   + If the current window has been deleted then point must reside after
;;     deletion in the next edit-window in a circular meaning (i.e. if the
;;     last edit-window has been deleted, point must stay afterwards in the
;;     first edit-window). If a window unequal the current window has been
;;     deleted point must stay in the window before deletion at the same
;;     place.
;;
;; New adviced intelligent window-functions as replacement for these originals:
;; - `other-window'
;; - `delete-window'
;; - `delete-other-windows'
;; - `delete-windows-on'
;; - `split-window-horizontally'
;; - `split-window-vertically'
;; - `split-window'
;; - `display-buffer'
;; - `switch-to-buffer'
;; - `switch-to-buffer-other-window'
;; - `other-window-for-scrolling'
;; - `balance-windows'
;; The behavior of the adviced functions is:
;; - All these function behaves exactly like their corresponding original
;;   functions but they always act as if the edit-window(s) of ECB would be the
;;   only window(s) of the ECB-frame. So the edit-window(s) of ECB seems to be
;;   a normal Emacs-frame to the user.
;; - If a durable compile-window is used all buffers for which
;;   `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil are handled in the
;;   compile-window!
;;
;; IMPORTANT: A note for programming Elisp for packages which work during
;; activated ECB (for ECB itself too :-): ECB offers three macros for easy
;; temporally (regardless of the settings in `ecb-advice-window-functions'!)
;; using all original-functions, all adviced functions or only some adviced
;; functions:
;; - `ecb-with-original-functions'
;; - `ecb-with-adviced-functions'
;; - `ecb-with-some-adviced-functions'

If you want a compilation window shown at the bottom of the ECB-layout

current layout with `ecb-redraw-layout' then the compilation window (if any)
has the height you set here. If the number is less than 1.0 the height is a
fraction of the frame height.

If you do not set a durable compilation window then doing a compilation or
displaying temp-buffers \(e.g. *Help*-buffers) splits temporally the edit
window vertically if the edit window is not splitted already or uses another
edit window temporally for compilation output if the edit window is already
splitted. This is the recommended value for this option because this is the
standard-behavior of Emacs.

Beware: If you set a durable compilation window then ECB displays all buffers
for which `ecb-compilation-buffer-p' returns not nil in that durable
compilation window. If a buffer which should being displayed there is not
displayed there then try to modify the options `ecb-compilation-buffer-names',
`ecb-compilation-major-modes' or `ecb-compilation-predicates' \(in this
sequence).

See also the options `ecb-compile-window-temporally-enlarge' and
`ecb-enlarged-compilation-window-max-height' and also the command

ECB offers the functionality of such a durable compile-window regardless if
the special ECB-windows are visible or not \(see the command
`ecb-toggle-ecb-windows').

- nil: Do not split the edit-area of ECB after activation, i.e. there will be
  only one edit-window after starting ECB.
- 'horizontal: Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows side by side.
- 'vertical: Split the edit-area in 2 edit-windows, one above the other.
- 'before-activation: Split the edit-area as before the ECB-start, i.e. the

- 'before-deactivation: Split the edit-area into a window-layout ECB had in
  its edit-area direct before the ECB-deactivation. This value preserves the
  full state between activations of ECB, i.e. the visibility of the

Some remarks to the value 'before-activation: If this value has been set then
ECB needs four permanent adivces even when ECB is deactivated: `split-window',
`delete-window', `delete-other-windows' and `set-window-configuration'. But
these advices do not change any behavior of these functions but only storing
in an internal ECB-variable the facts that a window has been splitted or
deleted etc. In addition to this these advices are 100% error-save, means the
functionality of the original functions will be performed in every\(!) case
even if within the advice an error occurs \(but normally there can no errors
occur in these advices because they are very simple). Conclusion: If you want
really all ECB-advices being disabled after deactivating ECB then you have to
set this option to other values then 'before-activation. But setting this
variable to this value is really completely save."

(defcustom ecb-other-window-behavior 'smart
  "*The behavior of ECB concerning getting an \"other window\".
This has an effect if either `other-window' or `other-window-for-scrolling' is
adviced by ECB, see `ecb-advice-window-functions'. The following settings are
possible:

'all:

ECB will cycle through all windows of the ECB-frame or scroll simply
the next window in the ECB-frame, means it behaves like the original
`other-window' rsp. the original `other-window-for-scrolling'.

'only-edit:

ECB will only cycle through the edit-windows of ECB or only
scroll another edit-window. If the selected window is not an edit-window
then it behaves like with value 'all.

'edit-and-compile:

Like 'only-edit plus the compile window if any. If the
selected window is neither an edit-window nor the compile-window then it
behaves like with value 'all.

'smart:

With this setting ECB tries to choose the `other-window'-destination or the
\"other window\" to scroll in a smart and intuitive way: If point is in one of
the edit-windows and if the edit-area is splitted then always the \"next\"
edit-window is choosen \(whereas the next edit-window of the last edit-window
is the first edit-window)- if the edit-area is unsplitted then the
compile-window is used if there is one. In the context of an
`other-window'-call the ARG of `other-window' will be taken into account.

If one of the special ecb-windows is selected then always the \"next\"
ecb-window is choosen \(whereas the next ecb-window of the last ecb-window is
the first ecb-window). In the context of an `other-window'-call the ARG of
`other-window' will be taken into account.

If the compile-window is selected then always the last selected edit-window
will be used unless `other-window' has been called with a prefix-argument
unequal 1.

If there is an active minibuffer:

Regardless of the allowed values above ECB handles the situation of an active
minibuffer during a call to `other-window' or `scroll-other-window' like
follows:

If the minibuffer-window is selected then ECB always chooses the window
`minibuffer-scroll-window' points to \(when this variable is set, otherwise
the compile-window or the last selected edit-window is choosen) when the
called command is called to choose the 1. next window \(always true for
scrolling another window or true when `other-window' called without prefix-arg
or with prefix-arg equal 1). Otherwise the window ARG steps away is choosen
\(in case of `other-window).

If there is an active minibuffer but the minibuffer-window is not selected
then `other-window' and `scroll-other-window' behave like the original
version.

In addition to the allowed values above the value of this option can also be a
function:

This function gets seven arguments:
1. A canonical list of all currently visible windows of the `ecb-frame'
2. A canonical list of all currently visible edit-windows
3. A canonical list of all currently visible ecb-windows
4. The window-object of the compile-window if there is any.
5. The minibuffer-window of the ECB-frame if there is an active minibuffer.
5. The result of the function `ecb-where-is-point' - see the documentation
   of this function for details.
6. An integer which indicates how many steps away from the current selected
   window the \"other-window\ is. Is nil when this function is called in
   another context then for `other-window'.
The function has to return a window-object which is then used as \"other
window\" for the command `other-window' or for scrolling another window
\(e.g. with `scroll-other-window').

This function has to handle all properly situations for itself.
`ecb-get-other-window-smart' is an example for such a function."

  For this one see also the option `ecb-other-window-behavior'!
- `delete-window'

- `split-window-horizontally'

- `switch-to-buffer'
- `switch-to-buffer-other-window'
- `display-buffer'
  Especially if `ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil it is strongly
  recommended not to disable this advice!
- `other-window-for-scrolling': If this advice is enabled then the behavior of
  the following functions depends on `ecb-other-window-behavior':
  - `scroll-other-window'
  - `scroll-other-window-down'
  - `beginning-of-buffer-other-window'
  - `end-of-buffer-other-window'
- `balance-windows': Only the edit-windows of the ecb-frame are balanced.

For working most conveniently with ECB it is the best to advice all these
functions, because then all the standard shortcuts of these functions are also
usable with ECB without doing anything else. Also other packages can interact
best with ECB if these functions are all adviced. If these adviced functions
are called in another frame than the ECB-frame they behave all exactly like the
not adviced versions!

But please read also the following:

Normally all packages should work correct with ECB and it´s adviced functions
but if there occur problems with a package cause of some of these adviced
functions ECB offers the following fall-back solution:

1. Deactivate in `ecb-advice-window-functions' all the adviced-functions which
   make problems with other packages.
2. For every of the advice-able functions <adv-FUNC> ECB offers a interactively
   function named \"ecb-<adv-func>\" which does exactly the same as the
   adviced version of <adv-func>. Use \"ecb-<adv-func>\" instead the original
   one to get the proper ECB behavior even if the function is not adviced
   anymore.
3. You can bind in `ecb-activate-hook' the standard-shortcut of <adv-func> to
   \"ecb-<adv-func>\" and rebind it in `ecb-deactivate-hook' to <adv-func>.
4. Now you have the best of both worlds: The problematic package works and you
   have the ECB-behavior of <adv-func> as if it would be adviced.

Here is an example: Suppose you must deactivating the advice for
`switch-to-buffer-other-window'. Then you deactivate this function with this
option and you can use `ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' instead. Bind the
shortcut you normally use for `switch-to-buffer-other-window' to
`ecb-switch-to-buffer-other-window' \(use `ecb-activate-hook' for this) and
rebind it to the original function in the `ecb-deactivate-hook'."

;; `display-buffer' can use but the real choosing-task is done by the function

(defadvice display-buffer (around ecb)
  "Makes this function compatible with ECB if called in or for the ecb-frame.
It displays all buffers which are \"compilation-buffers\" in the sense of
`ecb-compilation-buffer-p' in the compile-window of ECB. If the compile-window
is temporally hidden then it will be displayed first.

If there is no compile-window \(`ecb-compile-window-height' is nil) then it
splits the edit-window if unsplitted and displays BUFFER in the other
edit-window but only if `pop-up-windows' is not nil \(otherwise the
edit-window will not splitted).

All buffers which are not \"compilation-buffers\" in the sense of
`ecb-compilation-buffer-p' will be displayed in one of the edit-area and
`display-buffer' behaves as if the edit-windows would be the only windows in
the frame.

If BUFFER is contained in `special-display-buffer-names' or matches
`special-display-regexps' then `special-display-function' will be called \(if
not nil). But this behavior depends on the value of the option
`ecb-ignore-special-display'. The values of `same-window-buffer-names' and
`same-window-regexps' are supported as well.

See the value of the option `ecb-ignore-display-buffer-function'!

If called for other frames it works like the original version."

;; Macro for easy defining new layouts
(defmacro ecb-layout-define (name type doc &rest create-code)
  "Creates a new ECB-layout with name NAME which must be a string. TYPE is the
type of the new layout and is literal, i.e. not evaluated. It can be left,
right, top or left-right. DOC is the docstring for the new layout-function
\"ecb-layout-function-<name>\". CREATE-CODE is all the lisp code which is
necessary to define the ECB-windows/buffers. This macro adds the layout with
NAME and TYPE to the internal variable `ecb-available-layouts'.

Preconditions for CREATE-CODE:
1. Current frame is splitted at least in one edit-window and the column\(s)
   (for layout types left, right and left-right) rsp. row \(for a top layout)
   for the special ECB-windows/buffers. Depending on the value of the option
   `ecb-compile-window-height' there is also a compile window at the bottom of
   the frame which is stored in `ecb-compile-window'.

2. All windows are not dedicated.

3. Neither the edit-window nor the compile-window \(if there is one) are
   selected for types left, right and top. For type left-right the left
   column-window is selected.

4. All ECB-advices for the functions in `ecb-advice-window-functions' are
   disabled!

Things CREATE-CODE has to do:
1. Splitting the ECB-windows-column\(s)/row \(s.a.) in all the ECB-windows the
   layout should contain \(e.g. directories, sources, methods and history).
   The split must not be done with other functions than `ecb-split-hor' and
   `ecb-split-ver'! It is recommended not to to use a \"hard\" number of
   split-lines or -columns but using fractions between -0.9 and +0.9! Tip: It
   is recommended to spilt from right to left and from bottom to top or with
   other words: First create the right-most and bottom-most special windows!

2. Making each special ECB-window a dedicated window. This can be done with
   one of the following functions:
   + `ecb-set-directories-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-sources-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-methods-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-history-buffer'
   + `ecb-set-speedbar-buffer'
   Each layout can only contain one of each tree-buffer-type!

   In addition to these functions there is a general macro:
   + `ecb-with-dedicated-window'
   This macro performs any arbitrary code in current window and makes the
   window autom. dedicated at the end. This can be used by third party
   packages like JDEE to create arbitrary ECB-windows besides the standard
   tree-windows.

   To make a special ECB-window a dedicated window either one of the five
   functions above must be used or a function\(!) which calls in turn the
   macro `ecb-with-dedicated-window'. See the documentation of this macro how
   to use it!

   Such a function is called a \"dedicated setter\" and must\(!) use
   `ecb-with-dedicated-window' to make the window dedicated!

3. Every\(!) special ECB-window must be dedicated as described in 2.

4. CREATE-CODE must work correctly regardless if there is already a
   compile-window \(stored in `ecb-compile-window') or not
   \(`ecb-compile-window' is nil)

Things CREATE-CODE can do or can use:
1. Using the values of `ecb-compile-window-height', `ecb-windows-width',
   `ecb-windows-height' and `ecb-compile-window-width'.

Things CREATE-CODE must NOT do:
1. Splitting the edit-window
2. Creating a compile-window
3. Deleting the edit-window, the compile-window \(if there is any) or the
   ECB-windows-column\(s)/row \(see Precondition 1.)
4. Referring to the values of `ecb-edit-window' or `ecb-compile-window'
   because these values are always nil or undefined during CREATE-CODE.
5. Using the function `ecb-compile-window-live-p'.

Postconditions for CREATE-CODE:
1. The edit-window must be the selected window and must not be dedicated.
2. Every window besides the edit-window \(and the compile-window) must be
   a dedicated window \(e.g. a ECB-tree-window)."

Do not call this command from elisp-program but only interactively!

Called without a prefix-argument the state of the ECB-frame-layout will
preserved. This means:
- The state of compile-window \(hidden or visible) will be preserved but if
  visible then the height will be as specified in `ecb-compile-window-height'.
- The state of the ECB-windows will be preserved \(hidden or visible) but if
  visible then the sizes will be as specified in the layout \(and with the
  options `ecb-windows-width' and `ecb-windows-height') or as stored with
  `ecb-store-window-sizes'.

If called with ONE prefix-argument \(\[C-u]) then the layout will be drawn
with all ECB-windows and also with a visible compile-window \(when
`ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil). The splitting-state of the edit-area
will be preserved.

If called with TWO prefix-arguments \(i.e. hitting \[C-u] twice: \[C-u]
\[C-u]) then an emergency-redraw will be performed. This means the same as if
called with one prefix-argument \(s.a.) but the splitting-state of the
edit-area will NOT be preserved but all edit-windows besides the current one
will be deleted. Use this only if there are some anomalies after standard
redraws!

If the variable `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' is not nil then the redraw is done
by the `ecb-redraw-layout-quickly' function, otherwise by
`ecb-redraw-layout-full'.

Please not: It's strongly recommended to use the quick redraw only if you have
really slow machines where a full redraw takes several seconds because the
quick redraw is not really safe and has some annoying drawbacks! On normal
machines the full redraw should be done in << 1s so there should be no need
for the quick version!"

then ECB asks for the height of the compile-window, sets this height as new
value of `ecb-compile-window-height' and displays the compile-window \(so if
you have called this command by mistake and you do not want a compile-window
you have to quit with `C-g')."
